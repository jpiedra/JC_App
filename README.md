A repository for the Node.js-powered browser game

##About
Greetings, wayward traveler! This is my latest project: a dungeon-crawler game in which the user will not only be able to play as one of several characters, but also be able to load their own blueprints for maps to a database. The game will take you through maps uploaded by other players (or your own!), adding another layer of involvement to the game.

##Updates
**7/29/2015** - The sandbox database supporting this app has been decommissioned. Will look into finding a different hosting option in the near future. 

**2/1/2015** - The current version of this app is now hosted on Heroku! Even after some minor troubleshooting/code refactoring, it took all of 20-30 minutes to host and get working. Many thanks to them for their awesome platform. The link is available [here.](https://javacrypt.herokuapp.com/)
